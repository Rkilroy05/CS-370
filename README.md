**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**
This course was all about artificial intelligence, focusing on different ways to do machine learning. We mainly looked at reinforcement learning but also dived into deep Q-learning neural networks. Plus, we checked out various AI approaches like AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero. This field is really changing the game for software development because there are now chatbots out there that can help write and improve code. We also talked about the importance of ethics in AI, which is becoming a big deal as these technologies get more advanced and start taking on more tasks.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Basically, computer scientists use the scientific method—thinking up ideas, testing them out, and analyzing the results—every day. Whether they’re experimenting with new tech in their code or figuring out better ways to improve what’s already there, it’s all part of the job.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
I think the main challenge for people who are new to this industry is figuring out how to define a problem. It’s all about understanding the scope of what needs to be addressed and knowing which parts of the system are involved. Once you’ve nailed those steps, it’s really just about figuring out how the data will flow. With these three pieces in place, anyone can come up with a solution to just about any problem.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
It's tough to give a clear answer here because I don’t want to set up strict ethical rules that might limit my ability to help the end user or make things too complicated. I think being honest is always the best way to go. A lot of times, what makes something moral or immoral comes down to whether there’s consent. If the end user has a good understanding of how their data is being used, then we’ve pretty much sorted out the ethical side of things.
